# Neural Machine Translation system

Neural machine translation implemented with TensorFlow. When trained and tested on english-vietnamese translations of TED Talks (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/nmt/) it gets over 23 BLEU score.

Implementation was based on following tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/seq2seq

The code wasn't cleaned so it might be not very neat and nice in some places and it might lack some explanations that would be useful to put in the comments.
