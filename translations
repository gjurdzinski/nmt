When I was a kid , I thought that <unk> <unk> was the best country in the world and I usually sing &quot; We have nothing to envy . &quot;
I was very proud of my country .
In school , we spend a lot of time to learn about the master &apos;s life of Lake II , but not much more about the outside world except the United States , Korea and Japan is our enemies .
Although I was wondering , I was wondering how the world outside of the world , but I still think I &apos;d live my life in <unk> Athens , until all of the sudden things were changing .
When I was seven , I saw the scene of people that were actually running the first time in my life , but I still think my life is there is normal .
My family wasn &apos;t poor , and I never had to starve .
But one day of 1995 , my mother brought home a letter from a sister with her mom .
And in that there is written : When you read these lines , the whole family of five of my friends had no longer on this part of the world , because the whole house had nothing to eat in two weeks .
All right , all right , and our bodies are so weak that we can feel dead as death .
I was shocked .
Because it was the first time I knew that my cell was suffering .
Shortly after , when I went through a station , I saw a horror scene that I never could forget .
On the garage is the <unk> of a two hand woman who still hangs a <unk> and she just knows staring at her mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they &apos;re all worried for themselves and family .
In the mid 1990s , North Korea experienced a severe famine .
It makes more than a million Koreans died in the hunger , and many people survived the grass , the beetles and the <unk> .
The more electricity we have is that , normally , everything around me is all around the shadows when it comes to the dark , except light from the floor of China just my home , my home .
I always wonder why they had electricity , and we don &apos;t .
This is a picture from the North Korea of North Korea during the background of the countries around the world .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s the natural border between North Korea and China .
It can be very narrow , so some North Koreans are <unk> to China .
But many people died .
And I saw the exact same thing as they were floating on the river .
I can &apos;t tell you about how I &apos;ve been hiding North Korea , like how hard it was to say that in the difficult few months , I was sent to China to live with a long public .
I was thinking that I would have had a long time behind my family .
I never imagined that I would have had to be far away from 14 years .
In China , the life of a girl separated from the family as I was very tough .
I didn &apos;t even know what happened to the life of a refugee from North Korea , how it would be , but I soon realized that it wasn &apos;t very , very difficult , but it was incredibly dangerous , because refugees from North Korea in Korea were considered to be the right to be the right immigrants .
I always lived in a very intuitive fear that my identity would be detected , and I would be returned to the old life in North Korea .
One day , that nightmare was true , I was in the Chinese police , and I brought it to the police department to make the case .
Someone reported that I was North Koreans , so they tested my Mandarin , and asked me a lot of questions .
I was so scared , and I felt like my heart was going to explode .
Because if they saw something unnatural , I would be <unk> in prison and then get returned to water .
I think my life came here to end , but I still tried to control my emotions and answers them .
After all , one of the two cops said to the other , this is a false score .
It &apos;s not North Koreans . &quot;
And they released me . It was a magic .
And some North Koreans in China went to the neighboring embassy of the foreign occupation to refugee refugees , but many of them were arrested by the Chinese police and was returned to water .
These girls were lucky .
Because even though it was arrested , but finally finally released out of the same international effort .
But North Koreans is not so fortunate .
Every year , there are many North Koreans who were caught in China and were returned to water , where they were tortured , being imprisoned or executed .
While I was very lucky , it was a lot of my cells that weren &apos;t that much .
North Koreans had to cover their identities and struggle to survive as a tragedy .
Even when I learned Chinese language and found a job , then their life could be completely isolated in a moment .
That &apos;s why after 10 years of blocking the checklist I decided to risk myself to South Korea , to start a new life again .
The stability is more difficult to be here than I think it &apos;s much more difficult to imagine .
Because in Korea , English has very important positions , so I started learning English , my third language .
I also realized that a huge gap between South Korea and North Korea .
We were all Koreans , but it became very different from the consequence of 67 years of cut .
I &apos;ve been through a crisis of my own sources .
I &apos;m South Korea or North Korea ?
Where am I coming from ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , I had no country to be proud of what the country is .
Although I was interested in the living in Korea , it was not easy , but I made a plan .
And we started to learn to prepare the university .
But even though I just had to get familiar with life here , I was advised a horrible news .
North Korea has discovered that the number of Korea I sent to my family , and , to punish , would have been my family moving back to a <unk> zone in rural .
So let them quickly get out of that , I started to start making my family out of the way .
North Koreans had to overcome the gaps that seem to be impossible to come to freedom .
Because the remote cross of North Korea is almost impossible , so I have to fly to China , so I have to fly to China and go backwards to the North Koreans .
Because my family didn &apos;t know the Chinese language , so I had to go through people over 2,000 miles in China and to the East Asia .
The bus &apos;s journey lasted about a week , and a few times we were caught .
Once , our cars were <unk> and discovered by a Chinese cop .
He &apos;s actually <unk> the letters of everybody , and he started asking .
Because my family didn &apos;t understand Chinese language , so I thought they would be arrested .
When the Chinese cop came close to their <unk> , I immediately stood up and said to him that this was the deaf people I was going to have .
He looked at me suspicious , but fortunately he believed me .
And we kept on to the <unk> border , and I had to use almost the same amount of money that I had to bribe for people who guard border border guards .
However , after we got to the border , my family was arrested for the <unk> of the border .
After I applied money and I gave bribes , my family was released in a month , and then again again in the <unk> capital .
It &apos;s the best time in my life .
I &apos;ve done all the ways to get my family to the freedom , and I &apos;m close to the same , but they were already captured by the time we were just in the Senate when the Korean embassy was very short .
I went back to the middle of the middle of the landscape and the police department , looking for ways to get my family out of it , but I didn &apos;t afford money to bribe or pay the money anymore .
I was absolutely desperate .
It was true that there was a man who asked me , &quot; What &apos;s it ? &quot;
I was so surprised when a stranger is totally unfamiliar to ask me like that .
And in the very low English language , and a dictionary , I told him the scene of my family , and no one &apos;s going to the PlayStation <unk> , and the man had gone to the PlayStation <unk> paying all of my own money and the North Koreans , another way they could get to jail .
I was thanking him to be my heart , and I also asked him , &quot; Why did you help me ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t help you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m going to be in Koreans . &quot;
I realized that it was a moment that was incredibly significant in my life .
<unk> from strangers became a new symbol of hope for me and the North Koreans as we were desperately needed it , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community that the North rays were the ones that North Korea is looking for .
Finally , after a long journey I and my family were reunited in South Korea , but it was only half of the competition just half of the struggle .
Many North Koreans are being divided with their families , and when they arrive to another country , they have to start with very little or near the same money .
So we can take aid from international communities for education , educating English , teaching jobs , and many other fields .
We can also play as a bridge between people who are in North Korea with the outside world , because there are many of us who are holding together with other families in the country , and we share with them information and money to change North Korea from the inside .
I was very fortunate to get a lot of help and inspiration throughout my life , so I wanted to be able to share my country to give my country a chance to grow with international support .
I believe you &apos;ll see more and more North Koreans in every world , including on the TED stage .
Thank you .
I &apos;m just a requirement .
Please don &apos;t tell me that I &apos;m normal .
Now I want to show you my brothers now .
<unk> 22 year old , high and beautiful .
You don &apos;t talk about it , but I &apos;m telling you the joy of the way that even some of the best heroes couldn &apos;t do .
<unk> knows what love is .
I split it into a condition of no matter how much .
She wasn &apos;t greedy . He wasn &apos;t <unk> color .
You don &apos;t care about the religious differences , and let &apos;s understand that : He never lied .
When I sing songs from our childhood , trying to recall the words that I could never , and I couldn &apos;t remember what I think is the one that we know about the brain , and what we don &apos;t know about it is how great we are .
And I was so high . I was tall . I was very , very handsome .
I had a perfect memory .
But also , there &apos;s selection .
You don &apos;t remember me if I had my chocolate <unk> , but I remember the following record of every song on my iPod , and the talks between us from four years old , who had been on my hands on the front of the day on <unk> <unk> , and her birthday of Lady Gaga .
Now , what &apos;s it that sounds like this ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because of our minds , I don &apos;t fit up with the normal social version , they often get through and understand .
But what struck my heart more gently and my soul is more powerful than that , although this is true , although they &apos;re not considered normal , that it &apos;s only possible : these are the people who are committed to autism and the extraordinary .
For you not very familiar with the phrase &apos; autism , it &apos;s a brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes the physical function .
The disease rate per individual , that &apos;s why <unk> is so different from this .
And in the world , every 20 minutes , there &apos;s a person who has been diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the most extensive disorders with the fastest speed in the world , we &apos;re not clear whether or treatment .
And I can &apos;t remember the first time I approached autism , but I couldn &apos;t remember one day without it .
I was three years old when my birth was born and I was fascinated by a new person in my life .
And after a few months , I realized that I was different .
I was yelling .
You don &apos;t want to play like children else , and in fact , you don &apos;t like to enjoy me or something else .
<unk> live and political in our own world , with their own rules , and I feel the joy of the most improbable , like the car surrounding the room and staring at the washing machine and having anything in the hands of the hands .
When I grew up , I became different , and the difference became clearer .
But outside of the anger and <unk> and <unk> of <unk> is something that is unique : a pure instinct and a naive , a boy looking at life not a bit of a <unk> , a person who never lied .
It &apos;s usually a lot .
Well , I can &apos;t deny that there was a few moments in my family , moments I wish I &apos;m afraid of as I am .
But I took my memory back to what they taught me about personality , the way that I learned and my love and I realized that this is what I would not be able to swap to get the normal .
The normal thing that &apos;s missing the beauty that the difference gives us and how different we are , doesn &apos;t mean one of us is okay .
It means that there &apos;s a different type of &quot; right &quot; .
And if I can only convey one thing for <unk> and for Sam and give you , that &apos;s you don &apos;t have to be normal .
You can &apos;t .
Because there &apos;s autism or not , the difference between us we have a gift , everyone else has a gift , and honestly , in pursuit of the world &apos;s biggest potential sacrifice .
Our great opportunity for generosity , progress and change , when we try to become like another person .
Please don &apos;t say I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
You all agree with me this is a beautiful road .
It &apos;s built from plastic , and plastic is a material that runs in it , so it &apos;s very <unk> , but not always , especially not in these days today when it &apos;s so much rain .
Then you can get water on the highway .
And especially if you &apos;re cycling , and you &apos;re going to go through these cars , and you don &apos;t really look good .
Also , plastic is also more noise .
It &apos;s a <unk> material , if we do the same way of the Dutch , which is very close to cities , we want a quiet road .
The solution to the problem is to do the streets from asphalt .
Plastics are the materials we &apos;re taking for building most countries in Holland , and it has holes and water just covered through <unk> because all the rain will get out , and you have a vehicle to drive . So no <unk> <unk> .
And noise disappeared through holes .
Because it &apos;s very empty , all the noise goes away , so it &apos;s very quiet .
Now , of course , there &apos;s still a lot of illegal , and the <unk> of this street is the <unk> , the <unk> .
What is broke ? You see it on the street that &apos;s covered in the <unk> .
So first you get a rock , and more and more , more and more , more , and then , I &apos;m not going to do that .
But they can do it for your own car window . So you &apos;re not happy .
And after all , this is going to break more tomorrow .
Sometimes they make the chicken .
Well . He &apos;s ready .
There &apos;s chicken , of course , to be a problem , but we have solutions .
And you see , you see here the material has damage .
It &apos;s a plastic plastic , as I said , you have a small amount of biting in the middle of the rock .
Under the weather effects , the solar radiation , this plastic <unk> , this plastic <unk> , this plastic <unk> contains the debris between these assembly blocks will contract , and if it &apos;s again , it &apos;ll have a very close set of ruins and then sticking out of the blocks .
And then if you drive on that road , you destroy these end blocks as we just saw here .
So to solve this problem , we &apos;ve engineered the materials that are self assembled .
If we made this self assembling material , we can find solutions .
So what we can do is we can use a steel piece of wire that we could wash up <unk> <unk> , and we cut a small <unk> package of steel , and we mix these little pieces with <unk> <unk> .
So we have plastic <unk> with very small steel tubes .
And you need a machine , as you can see here , the machine to cook a sensor .
So , you can take a magnetic effect , you can make a difference , and steel is very good at the end .
What you do is heating up steel , and you <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> will flow into these little cracks , and the stones will stick up into the surface .
I &apos;m using a wave of wave because I couldn &apos;t give the sensors from a thriving ground .
<unk> cable has the same system system .
I left the prototype in the oven , I &apos;m going to take it right now to check how it looks .
This is a prototype that was taken out .
I said we invented a factory like on the lab to heat the samples .
So in the lab we tried a lot of samples , and then the government , they actually saw the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s cool . We have to try to see . &quot;
And then they gave us a line of 50 meters , and they were 400 meters of <unk> <unk> , and we had to build this new new physical test .
So that &apos;s what we did here . You see the path that we did , and then of course this path will be in many years without damage . That &apos;s what we learned from experimental experimentation .
We took a lot of samples from this path , and we tried them in the lab .
So we &apos;re old modeling , put loads of loads on it , and they stick them up with sensors , and they &apos;re <unk> them and then they try and then again .
We can do it again .
And really , the conclusion came from this study that if we protect the four year street a year with a machine that we &apos;ve created this size of a massive size , we built it to protect the actual sugar , and then we can actually double the way we can grow the middle of the hill of the Main River , and then we would save a lot of money .
Well , to wrap up , I can tell you that we created a kind of a steel type of steel , add a steel beam , using the heat , so that actually help increase the lifespan of the road , so that it &apos;s going to be a little bit of life expectancy , and it &apos;s a little bit of a road expectancy , which is right now , and you &apos;re doing it , and you &apos;re making it twice , you &apos;re making it twice more .
Now you &apos;re wondering if it works .
We also prototype here . It &apos;s pretty warm .
It &apos;s supposed to be cool to give it a break , and I showed you the effect of the therapies .
But let me try to see .
Look . Well , it sticks .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a question of confusing , which is also not as bad as the answer .
The theme is the secret of domestic violence , and the question I asked is the question that everybody always asks : Why is she staying ?
Why should women stay with the person who beat them ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , not a social partner or professional expert expert .
I &apos;m just a woman who wants to share my story .
I was 22 years old , and I graduated at Harvard College .
I moved to New York City when I was working first and editor for <unk> magazine .
For the first time I had my apartment , my own American American Express card , and I had a big secret .
The secret is , this gun was stripped <unk> <unk> <unk> placed up in my head because the man I thought was the partner , and this time again .
The man who was more loving the gun and killed me and killed me I didn &apos;t remember it all .
I &apos;m here to tell you about the crazy love , a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s decorated the love of love that millions of women and even some men have to every year .
This is probably your story .
I don &apos;t like a family scientist .
I had English &apos;s English degree from Harvard School School , and NGOs from the <unk> School of <unk> .
I ran up with my work for companies in the U.S. Fortune Fortune Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson &amp; gt ; Times &amp; amp ; Times &amp; gt ; .
I married with my second husband , 20 years ago , and there was three children .
My dog is like the Hole , and I was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the first thing I want to tell you is that domestic violence happens with all the people , every kind of every one , every level of income and education .
It happens everywhere .
And the second thing I want to say is that people think that domestic violence happens to women , which is the issue of women .
It &apos;s not true .
Over 85 percent of the geeks are men , and domestic violence happened in the relationships of the mechanisms , to lock , long term , long term , to say , in the family , where we would expect or expect that violence is a reason for violence to be a problem for why domestic violence is a problem .
I told myself , I &apos;m the other left of the world living with man who beat himself , but I was , I &apos;m a classic agent of my age .
I was 22 years old , living in America , women from 16 to 24 hours of risk as a victim of the family of the elderly , and on the other 500 and a half times as old as the victims of the elderly , and on 500 women and the girls in the ages of this age were killed every year by violence , and you , and the boys are
I was also a typical victim because I didn &apos;t know anything about domestic violence , warning or pattern .
I met <unk> in a month , and it rains cold and cold .
He sat next to me in the streets of New York City , and he started to me .
He told me about two things .
One is he , as well as I was , graduated from the League League — and that he worked at a very impressive bank in Wall Street .
But the most striking thing to me was that he was smart and he was smart and he looks like he looked a little bit .
He had a pair of <unk> that this big , giant left little pair of her mouth and <unk> like yellow fields and he seems very sweet .
One of the smartest things <unk> did , since the beginning of the beginning , was to create a hallucination that I was an extraordinarily promising relationship .
He did this for the first time by holding me .
We started dating , and he loved me every aspect that I was smart , that I chose Harvard , that I was passionate for the developing girls and jobs .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood , my hopes and dreams .
<unk> Believe me , as a writer and a woman in the way that no one has ever had .
And he also creates the magical air of the confidence between us by getting his secrets by getting his secrets , that he was like a child from four years old being abused by himself alone and constantly by his father , and his <unk> became bad to him to leave the school at eight , although he was very smart and he took his almost 20 years to rebuild his life .
And that explains why at the <unk> <unk> and the work in Wall Street and his bright future , and his bright future means how big it is to him .
If you tell me that the smart man , please , who I am , the beloved one day I could make a <unk> when I was given a focus or no , my skirts is a brief , where I live , where I &apos;m doing , who &apos;s my friend and where I retire , and I &apos;m going to sit on you because there &apos;s no <unk> of violence or controls or <unk> in <unk> from the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first phase of domestic violence is to be <unk> and seduction .
I don &apos;t know that the second phase of the event is isolated .
Now , <unk> didn &apos;t return to a day and announced &quot; Hey , &quot; and I don &apos;t know , all the churches and the <unk> is great , but I need to move to the next stage where I &apos;m isolated and running her &quot; — — — so I need to take her out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear her screaming and out of the city where she had friends and family and his colleagues and colleagues to see purple experiences . &quot;
So , <unk> came home on Friday night and he said to me that he spent working today the dream of his dream , and he said , he &apos;s giving me a job because I &apos;m , because I &apos;m making you feel safe and loved that he doesn &apos;t need to prove herself in the Wall Street , and he wanted to go out of the town far away from his own city and his own day , and he wanted to go out to the town outside of his own town and his own day , and he &apos;s going to start to get his life to my life .
Now , the last thing I want to do is leave New York and my dream of my dreams , but I thought you had to sacrifice your life , so I agree and I retire , <unk> and I together left Manhattan .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve been working in a crazy love , that I was walking into the first step of my brain , money and character , and it was been organized carefully .
The next step in this violent scenario is to put into the violent threats and see how she responds .
Here , the gun came in .
When we moved to New England , you know , where <unk> based on it is safe to feel that he &apos;s going to buy three guns .
He keeps a tree in the crisper drawers of our car .
A tree underneath our beds , our third bed tree , is the third we &apos;ve been in the middle of the middle .
And he said he needed these guns because the damage that he had had during the past was a child .
He needed them to feel protection .
But these gun are actually a message for me , and although he hadn &apos;t delivered his arm on me , my life was in danger every minute every day .
<unk> has attacked me five days ago in my wedding .
It &apos;s at 7 a.m. when I was wearing my pajamas .
I &apos;m <unk> on the top of the line , and I &apos;m <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , I think , I think , as I say , <unk> , I think , as a curable of my <unk> to get two arms around my neck and I could hold myself to my <unk> and I can &apos;t breath , and he &apos;d use his head of his head hit the wall constantly .
Five days later , 10 hits on my neck I had been clear , and my dress dress , and married him .
And for the things that happened , I &apos;m sure we &apos;re going to live happily because I love him and he loves me a lot .
And he was very <unk> .
He was really deeply nervous because the wedding and the family was with me .
It &apos;s a very , very good fishing , and he &apos;s never going to hurt me .
It &apos;s been made twice in the week of the secret .
For the first time , I was driving a secret beach , and I was lost , and he hit one side of my head so powerful that I was constantly constantly beating to the window of the car .
A few days later , when I was driving back home after week after week , he was tired of the car , and he threw the whole food bag in my face .
<unk> <unk> kept me one week every week during two months and half years from marriage .
I was wrong to think that I was the only one and I am alone in this .
One third of American women who underwent domestic violence or <unk> in some of their lives and reported the CDC for the next stage has been the 15 million <unk> of each year , 15 million .
So I actually was in a very good company .
I was going to ask you to ask me questions : Why am I staying ?
The answer is easy .
I don &apos;t know him who was on my face .
He even <unk> me in my head , push me down to the floor , threatening my wife &apos;s <unk> , giving me the keys out of the car when I was driving in the highway of <unk> coffee on my head when I was wearing my laundry for my interview , I never once thought I was like a <unk> of mine .
Instead , I &apos;m a strong woman in love with a man who has trouble , and I was the only one on Earth who can help her face with his evil evil .
The other question that everyone asked is , why don &apos;t she leave away ?
Why did I not walk ? I can quit any time .
For me , it &apos;s the most painful and most painful question , because we , the victims that you don &apos;t know , are quite , really dangerous to get off a bully like that .
Because the final step in the professional violence is killing her .
Over 70 percent of domestic crime attacks happened after victims end up after the marriage , after she left , because then the violence was no longer needed .
But the other thing that &apos;s been seen is that long term , even after the <unk> of the suicide charges , from the financial sources ; the working of the entire family system to be shocked victims and her children , these kids often become compelled by the judgment of time that had not been treated with the men who beat their mothers .
And we have to go on and say , why don &apos;t she leave away ?
I could quit , because a very last <unk> hit my <unk> .
I realized that the man I loved was really sorry to kill me if I fell out of him .
So I broke the silence .
I told people : the uncle , the neighbors , friends and family , the alien people , and I stand here today because you &apos;re all helping me .
We have an idea of the <unk> of victims as well as the scary headlines , the <unk> women who are destructive , the good things that hurt .
The question , &quot; Why is she left ? &quot;
And so , for some people , &quot; That &apos;s her fault when the victim chooses to love men with the idea of destruction .
But since I published &quot; <unk> Love &quot; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of stories from men and women who &apos;ve left a life lesson of life , but what happened , and who built the lives of happiness , the wives , the moms , the mother who lives totally without violence , as I am .
Because the truth I &apos;m in is a typical human violence , which ended me up as a typical family survivor from family force .
I married with a young and good man , and we had three children .
I have a <unk> <unk> and I have a <unk> .
What I never had is half a rifle gun , and I was a <unk> in my head because someone said he loved me .
Right now , you might be thinking , &quot; Oh , this is great , &quot; or &quot; Oh , &quot; how are you just going to be a little bit but all of this time , I really talked about you .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re in the audience who &apos;s listening to me right now , who are being abused or who are being abused when their kids are <unk> or who are self abused .
The self can influence your daughter , your little sister , your best friend right now .
I can end my crazy love story by breaking up silence .
I &apos;m beating the silence today .
This is how I help other victims , and this is my final request .
Let &apos;s tell you what you &apos;re hearing here .
<unk> is terrifying in silence .
You have the power to end the patient simply by clicking that into a light .
We need to get all the people to go .
We need you to understand the secret of domestic violence .
<unk> the <unk> of today &apos;s light , by talking about it with your kids , your colleagues , your friends and family .
<unk> their lives as well as happy , as well as the happy , the <unk> future .
Knowing the early news of violence and the lies of conscience , down to the victim , just for the road to be safe .
Together we can make our sleep go to bed and our family and our family , and we can get to be <unk> and safe objects .
Thank you .
I want to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
<unk> Maisonnier is one of the most threatened groups of birds .
When you see a dragonfly like this , the first thing to happen in your head is that , these are the disgusting creatures , the ugly , to eat and target the meat you &apos;re in , to the politicians .
I want to change that realization . I want to change the feelings you spend for these birds , because they need to be compassionate . They really need to be .
I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why do they have such such a bit of bad impression ?
When Charles Darwin passed the Pacific in 1850 from the <unk> , he found wild <unk> , he said , &quot; These birds are so disgusting with red heads created to applaud in the <unk> .
You can &apos;t get a little <unk> than that , and that &apos;s the words Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed the idea of when he turned back , let me tell you why .
They &apos;ve been connected to Disney characters by <unk> characters , <unk> , stupid .
More recently , if you &apos;re tracking news in Kenya , these are properties that are associated with <unk> , but I want to resist that .
I want to resist because you know how ?
Because the landscape doesn &apos;t hold the environment in clean clean environment .
The landscape doesn &apos;t help prevent disease spread .
They hardly manage a spouse .
They were also extinct .
And , what I like most is , <unk> would look much better .
There are two <unk> on the planet .
The World <unk> <unk> found mainly in the United States , like <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the World Nation , where there are 16 species . In many species , there are 11 species of species facing endangered risk .
So , why is vultures so important ? First of all , they provide the essential ecological services . They end up .
They &apos;re really natural <unk> .
They clean themselves down to their bodies .
They help to kill bacteria . They help us to absorb anthrax that they could spread and cause enormous losses for livestock livestock and cause for other animals .
The most recent studies that showed in areas that have no <unk> <unk> would have been about three to four times as much as to break , and the vast consequence of this is the spread of disease .
<unk> <unk> has a wonderful history of their importance .
They &apos;ve been connected to ancient Egypt .
<unk> is the symbol of the guard and the mother , and with the tigers , and the spirit of tiger , they encode the agreement between the domain of the speech ; the <unk> of Egypt .
In the Hindu mythology , <unk> is <unk> <unk> , who was taking risks to help her <unk> from the hands of the <unk> 10 by the <unk> .
In the West culture , they do the very important angel . In places like Tibet , there &apos;s no place to bury dead people , or there &apos;s no wood to burn them , so these crabs provide a natural waste system .
So how are the Devil ?
We have eight species of vultures in Kenya , in which there are six species of endangered species with endangered risk .
The reason is they &apos;re being poison , they &apos;re poison because there are events between humans and wild worlds . communities are using this poison to get into predators , but instead , floods are the victims of this .
In South Asia , countries like India and Pakistan , four <unk> are inscribed in the list of super high risk that means they &apos;re less than 10 or 15 years to touch the absolute extinction and the reason that they &apos;re turned into prey because they have to be treated by a <unk> , because they have to be treated by a <unk> , because they have been treated by a <unk> , because they have been <unk>
This medicine has been banned in the Indian interest in India , they proved that they &apos;ve proven .
Because there is no Devil should have a huge amount of <unk> in the region of the <unk> of the living zone where you have a wild , you have a giant , giant , 10 year old ticking bottle of <unk> that has a huge deal in India .
Kenya will have the largest powered band of <unk> in Africa with <unk> <unk> .
I don &apos;t have a <unk> of wind , but we need to work with government , because the wind that causes these birds to be the birds . They cut it .
They &apos;re a <unk> <unk> .
In West Africa there is a terrible trade trade in the world for the magic market and <unk> .
So what did we do ? We &apos;re doing research on these birds . We &apos;re doing a radio detector .
We &apos;re trying to figure out how to find our basic ecology , and they &apos;re in the spot where they come .
We can see them moving into a lot of different countries , so if you focus on the issues on the area of regional scale , this won &apos;t work for you .
We need to collaborate with government on the area of the region .
We &apos;re collaborating with local communities .
We &apos;re telling them about <unk> <unk> need to be sure for these amazing creatures and the benefits that they bring .
How do you help ? You can become a human being , create a voice . You can write your own letter for your own government and tell them that we need to focus on these organisms that are misunderstood . <unk> a message .
When you walk out of this room , you get the <unk> of mockingbird birds , but let &apos;s tell your family , your kids , your neighbor , your neighbor .
They &apos;re very glamorous . Charles Darwin said he had a clue that he saw the gun as he did not need to be a bit negative in the sky .
Kenya , in this world , will be much richer if there are no great animals .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 years old , I remember one morning wake up when I heard the song in my house .
My father was listening to the BBC on his little gray radio .
He raised a very large smile , which is very unusual because it was almost more news to believe him .
He goes , &quot; We have gone . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know very well , but I can see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; Now you can actually come into school , &quot; he said .
I can &apos;t forget that one morning .
It was a really real school .
You know , the Taliban come to the Afghan <unk> since I was six years old and blocking girls to go to school .
In the next five years , I was dressed as a son to come with my sister to a secret because my sister was banned from my house .
That &apos;s the only way we can go to school .
Every day , we &apos;re going to get a different road in the road that nobody has no suspects on our destination .
We hid books in the shipyard , and we would think we &apos;d just go shopping .
The school in a house , over 100 of our children were tied down in a small living room .
Quite warm in winter , but summer is extremely hot .
We all know that our own life is taking their lives , our students and their parents .
There &apos;s a couple of times , a school that suddenly closes about a week for a week for a suspected .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Can we have been tracked ?
Do they know where we were ?
We were scared , but yet , we still wanted to go to school .
I &apos;m very fortunate to be taught in a very privileged family and a girl who is great .
My grandfather was a tough person who was in the moment .
One is completely abandoned from a foreign foreign , <unk> , <unk> boy to be in school , and so he had his father up .
But the mother has my education teacher .
She &apos;s here .
She retired two years ago to use our house to open the school for girls and women in their neighbors .
And this is my father who was the first person in his family &apos;s family .
No doubt that his female would be educated , including his daughter , regardless of the Taliban , and despite the dangers .
For him , the female is not learning as much .
In the Taliban , I remember that there were moments I was angry about our lives and were terrified and not seen the future .
I &apos;d love to go up to my school , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , I can lose everything you have on this life .
The animal &apos;s DNA can be robbed . You can get forced from the home during the war .
But one thing that &apos;s going to be with you is that , if we &apos;re forced to sell blood to pay money , we will do it .
So , does it even go on ?
I &apos;m 22 years old today .
I was raised in a country that was being consumed by the many <unk> .
Less than six percent of my youth were learned after the average school , and if my family was not commitment to my education , I also became one of them .
But , I &apos;m proud of this as a graduate student <unk> <unk> .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , who was abandoned by his family , because he gave his daughter to go to school , was one of the first people to celebrate me .
He wasn &apos;t showing me my degree of college , but I was the first woman , and I was the first woman who could carry him on the streets of Kabul .
My family believed me .
I dreamt that I wanted to make a big wish , but my family was a little older .
So I was a global ambassador for <unk> , which is a global movement for women .
So I made <unk> , the first school and the only way for girls in Afghanistan , a country that was still dangerous for girls to school .
I &apos;m excited to see my students to come to my school with the hopes to get this opportunity .
And I saw their parents and their father like my father , supporting them , despite , even when I was having a lot of difficulty .
And Ahmed . It &apos;s not his true name , and I can &apos;t show his face , but Ahmed was my dad &apos;s dad .
Less than a month , he and his daughter were on the way to <unk> from their village , and they were actually <unk> by a single bomb in a few minutes .
When he was home , the <unk> phone , a voice threatening voice he could keep on the school , and they &apos;ll try and again .
He said , &quot; If you want to kill me , I &apos;m going to kill my daughter , because the ideas of the &quot; versus &quot; challenges and challenges .
I now have this now , and this is what it used to be , and this is the most overlooked place in the West , and it &apos;s behind most of us who are a father who value the value of their daughter and the viewer who &apos;s the kind of success of their daughter as their own success .
This is not the case that mothers don &apos;t matter in our success .
In fact , they were the first person and the hypothetical who persuasive a kind of a girl &apos;s future , but in the context of Afghanistan , we need to reach the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls who come to school spend hundreds of people who remembered , that &apos;s illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in the school of Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks very different when we look from the United States .
I see that Americans see fragile , fragile , hidden things .
I &apos;m afraid that all of those changes won &apos;t last longer after the American military had gone .
But when I came back to Afghanistan , when I saw my students in my school and my parents support them , encouraging them , I saw a promise and changed that was long term .
For me Afghanistan is a country of hope , the ability to not limit , and every day of <unk> <unk> reminds me about it .
As I , they have a big dream .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my cell phone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and a phone that gives you personal freedom .
With a cell phone , you can record the <unk> of human rights actions in Syria .
With a cell phone , you can post a message on fine and start joining a protest in the state of government in Egypt .
And also with a telephone you can film a song , posting it on <unk> and become famous .
All of that is completely possible to your cellphone .
I &apos;m a child of 1984 , and I lived in the city of Rio .
Let &apos;s go back to that moment , in the city .
You can see here the way thousands of people stand up and show the change .
It &apos;s in 1989 , and imagine the people who have stood up and the protests that have a mobile phone in their pockets .
Who in the audience has mobile phones ?
Please raise it .
Please raise your phone , raise your phone up !
Please raise it up . A Android phone , your Blackberry , wow .
A lot . Today , most of us have a mobile phone .
But today I &apos;m going to talk about myself and my phone , and about how it changed my life .
I &apos;m going to talk about that .
There &apos;s about <unk> data .
<unk> information .
But why is that information here ?
The reason for the next was the year of 2006 , the European Commission proposed a policy unit .
It &apos;s called the <unk> of data .
This one shows that every telecom company in Europe , every single Internet service provider globally , has to store vast amounts of information about users .
Who &apos;s called who they are ? Who sent someone emailing ?
Who sent for a cell message ?
And if you use cell phones , this is where the problem exists .
All of this information is stored at least for six months , until the next two years by your home is using or provider service provider .
And all over Europe , people have stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want that . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want to have this personal archive .
We wanted to get the same in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want to say that telecommunications and Internet services have gone back to all of their information .
They &apos;re lawyers , journalists and fathers , all said , &quot; We don &apos;t want that . &quot;
And you can see here , like 10,000 people in the street march on the Berlin street and the <unk> , and not afraid .
And some people even said , it &apos;s like <unk> 2.0 .
<unk> is the force force force in Eastern Germany .
I &apos;ve also wondered , does it work ?
Can they record all of our information ?
When we use our cell phones ?
So I asked my home to use , <unk> <unk> , the largest telecom provider of Germany at that time , and I asked them , please send me the whole of my whole information they &apos;ve stored .
I asked them to send me one last time , and I kept asking , but what I got was a not clear answer . <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Me .
But then I said , I want to get this information , because they were storing my life .
And I decided to send the case to the court , because I wanted to get this information .
But <unk> <unk> said , no , we &apos;re not going to give you this information .
And finally , I had a donation with them .
I &apos;m going to break it up , and they &apos;ll give me information I asked .
Because at that time , the federal constitution has defined that the only European Committee of the European Committee has not been working in the legal system in Germany .
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a CD on the inside .
And on the CDs , what I have to do is be recorded .
<unk> range of information .
So first I look at it , and I said , okay , it &apos;s a big data file . Good .
But then I realized , this is all my life .
This is my life in six months , and it &apos;s been recorded all of this data .
Then I got a little wondered , so what do I do with this ?
Because I can see where I went there , where I sleep every night , what I did .
But then I said , I want to do this publicly .
I want it to be known by the public .
Because I want to show people how real the data is really .
So for <unk> Online and Copyright Data City , I do the same thing .
These are intuitive images of life in six months that are recorded my own .
You can zoom in and make it smaller , you can reverse back or further forward .
You can see every step of my journey .
You can even know me to <unk> by the train , and how much I call the contact between those two places .
All of these things are possible .
I was a little terrified .
But that information is not just about me .
It &apos;s about all of us .
First of all , it &apos;s just like this , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talked to each other for three times .
And then some friends call me , they call each other .
And then you call you , and you call you , and you get this huge network of communication .
But you can see how we communicate with each other , when they &apos;re going to sleep .
You can see all that .
You can see the most momentous part , like the leaders in a group .
If you have access to this information , you can see the activity of the community , the society .
If you have access to this information , you can control the entire society .
This is a design drawing for countries like China or Iran .
This is a drawing of a whole society to look at society , because you know who talks to someone who &apos;s talking to , who sent out emails , all that would if you have access to this information .
And this information is stored at at least six months in Europe , until two years .
As I said when I started , imagine if all these people on the Berlin street fall in 1989 , there was a cell phone in his pocket .
Perhaps <unk> would know who was involved in this demonstration , and if <unk> knows who was the leader behind it , it might never be possible .
The collapse of the Berlin wall may not exist .
And if that &apos;s , perhaps the collapse of the iron in the Cold War wouldn &apos;t exist .
Because today , functional and policy agencies want to capture the information they get as much as possible , online and online .
They want to be able to track our lives , and because they want to record this information at all time .
<unk> and living in the digital age is not conflicting .
What you should do is fight your self &apos;s self .
And you have to fight the stop for it every day .
Then , when you go home , tell your friends that private power is a 21st century value , and that &apos;s not obsolete .
When you go home , tell your representative , that by companies and institutions that can hold the specific information , even though they don &apos;t necessarily have to do that .
And if you don &apos;t trust me , ask the housing to provide the information they &apos;ve stored on .
So in the future , every time you use your cell phone , let &apos;s remind you that you have to fight for self esteem in this algebra .
Thank you .
Photography is my passion since I was big enough to hold a camera , but I want to share with you 15 pictures of my life , and I &apos;m not taking one of them .
There &apos;s no art director , no builders , no shooting , even attention to the light .
In fact , most of them are taken by accidental visitors .
The story starts when I went to New York City to participate in a speech and my wife took me on my first birthday of her birthday birthday . We stood down down down down down down 55 kilometers and five .
We happened to go back to New York , and a year later , so we decided to take another one .
You can see where the story is .
When I was going to my third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Why don &apos;t you put <unk> to New York City doing a travel trip and daughter , and then go on to &quot; rituals ? &quot;
Since then we started with travel visitors through the street .
You know , the camera inspired your camera for a fully unfamiliar stranger in the world .
No one refused , and fortunately nobody had ever missed our camera .
We didn &apos;t know how much the journey was going to change our lives .
It became sacred to us .
This is a couple of weeks later , and I tried to explain what happened that day in the ways that a five year old child could understand .
These pictures are not only representative for a moment , or a special trip .
They &apos;re the way we can stop time in a late month of the October , thinking about our time and how we change each year , not only physically , but about every surface .
Because even though we took the same picture , our point of view changed , my daughter got new marks , and I was seeing my life through her eyes , how it looked and interact with all the things .
The time we focused on this one is something that we value and hopefully for year .
Recently , in a trip , we were walking , and my daughter suddenly stopped between the street , and it was only the red roof of the furniture that it was very much like when she was a little kid in the previous tour .
She described me to the feeling of five year olds , when she was standing at that position .
It said it &apos;s a little bit like my heart on the chest when it saw that <unk> for the first time , nine years ago .
And now what it sees in New York is the universities , because it decided to go to school in New York .
And I realized one of the most important things we create is memory .
So I want to share the idea of embracing the role of a memory .
I don &apos;t know how you might , but out of 15 pictures , I didn &apos;t appear to be much more in my family photographs .
I &apos;m always a picture .
So today I want to encourage everybody to be in the picture , and don &apos;t take any attention to someone , and ask , &quot; Can you take a picture of us ? &quot;
Thank you .
I never forget my grandmother &apos;s words to <unk> her in the <unk> : &quot; Hey , let me fight against magnesium . Let &apos;s fight him .
But don &apos;t make it a kind of <unk> human network . &quot;
Nearly two years came from the siege in Libya , which was being met by the <unk> of the elite waves from the <unk> of Tunisia and Egypt .
I joined the forces and outside Libya to call the day of wealth and to start a <unk> of demolition .
And that &apos;s a great revolution .
The young men are standing in front of their head , and they &apos;re going to stop their own , their freedom of freedom , their dignity , their social justice .
They &apos;ve been able to have a mirror of the emotional , the <unk> of the TNCs of Madonna .
They &apos;ve shown a <unk> of glue that came from east to west and to pull up to the south .
Finally , after six months of war due to the injury to 50,000 people , we managed to liberate our country and we would flip our own <unk> .
However , LISA left a heavy burden , a legacy of the specialized group , corrupt and split revenues .
For four decades , the tyranny of Gagarin &apos;s violence has destroyed infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral background of Libya .
<unk> awareness and challenges , I also have many other women , <unk> civil society , and the <unk> of Libya , calls the whole and transition process to democracy and national reconciliation .
Nearly 200 institutions were established in Benghazi during that time and after after that , after the <unk> collapsed of <unk> .
After 33 years of <unk> , I returned to Libya , with a single , most passionate enthusiasm , I started to organize my training classes , and I started to develop my head of leadership .
And the same group of women , I co founded the Women Women &apos;s Women &apos;s Women &apos;s Women , because the Democratic Peace pioneer of women , the leaders of society , are in the social order for women and to transport our rights to be equal to the government and to engage .
I was in the extreme position of the election , a very , very <unk> environment , a environment that was formed by political politics , and the <unk> .
I led my <unk> by the dawn of Women &apos;s Women &apos;s <unk> for the <unk> of a more comprehensive , more inclusive rule of law that could give citizens , whether they come out of the ground , whether they &apos;re born and argue , and most importantly , the rules for political parties must weave the male candidates and women in the edges of their list creating a shaped list .
And then we finally have been receiving and succeeded .
Women won <unk> percent of the Congress in the first elections in the first set of years in the first thousand years .
However , a little bit of a little bit , a <unk> from the election and the revolution of the general revolution , which is always going to go through us and wake up with the news about violence .
One day we were awake with the news of the <unk> of the ancient <unk> and the Mayan &apos; <unk> .
On the other day we woke up the news of the American <unk> and attack the <unk> .
On the other day we woke up with the news of the military officers .
And every day , every day we wake up with the rules of the force force and their communication behaviors , and the people with the people who are in their own lives and the uncertainty of their laws .
Our societies , our form of innovation , became more polarizing , and they left the ideals , the principles of freedom , the social equality , the social equality that we pursue at the first time .
<unk> , eliminating and leopards became symbols of the time .
I &apos;m here not a inspired word of creating a project that is made of creating a mission of a lock up list and the elections .
I &apos;m here to admit that we all have the whole country who has selected false , determined decision wrong .
We didn &apos;t prioritize civil rights .
Because the elections don &apos;t bring peace , stability or security .
Will the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> between male candidates and women brought peace and reconciliation in the country ?
No , no .
So finally , what did it help ?
Why do societies continue to be an incredibly active and political society because of the selfish political institutions and the exception , both of the men and women ?
Perhaps without the lack of feminist is women &apos;s rights , but also the amount of feminine values of compassion , tolerance , and total .
Our societies need a national dialogue and our empathy to build more of the elections , which is to just increase the polarization and divide of the polarization .
Our societies need to have the <unk> of the food , rather than the need and the number of women that bring the sex .
We need to stop acting like <unk> , stop <unk> , and not to stop a lot of regrets .
We need to start acting like the reporters of compassion and tolerance .
We need to develop a discussion that &apos;s compelling , but we have to do a business that &apos;s not just about a <unk> , but instead of <unk> , instead of <unk> , instead of subtraction .
These are the ideas that have needed a country that has been destroyed as Bilbao to be able to get to the <unk> .
Because peace is like a diamond , it needs to be <unk> , <unk> between male opinions and female .
That &apos;s the real lock .
And we needed to set up that long life before we do the political political face .
According to a poem in &quot; <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> &quot; is God &apos;s word God , God &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
Next , &quot; <unk> &quot; is known in the tradition of Abraham &apos;s roots , which is the &quot; <unk> &quot; which is the &quot; <unk> &quot; which shows female sex , which is the female and female , and from every tribe , every tribe , were born .
And because the fetus <unk> completely in its own way , the holy matrix of nurturing the entire sex matrix .
So we &apos;re taught , &quot; Our tolerance is a blind . &quot;
So we &apos;re taught , &quot; Our tolerance is triumph . &quot;
May each of us is <unk> of tolerance .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I went through something that was a little bit like Alice in the first one .
The Barefoot State School asked me , a teacher teaching a coach to give a lecture to live .
I was scared .
It &apos;s really scary . It &apos;s scared of the big students , the big books , the big words .
But when the trade competitions opened , I experienced what Alice had experienced when she fell into the cave and discovered the door that was a new new world .
It &apos;s just what I feel when I gave my students to my students , and I was amazed by their ideas , and I wanted to be somebody else who had this mental <unk> experience .
I believe that the key to opening the door to the world is the ability to communicate .
We &apos;re very , very important to the scientists and engineers to change the world .
Scientists and engineers are the people who are at the verge of the greatest challenges , from the energy to the environment and the health , and there &apos;s more , if we don &apos;t know and understand it , and I &apos;m convinced that our responsibility , those who are not professionals , are interacting with them .
But the results wouldn &apos;t happen if scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us to go to their own possessions .
Scientists and engineers , let &apos;s just take eight stories of <unk> with us .
I want to share some of the secrets to make sure that we realized that your science is so charming , so complex , and so hot .
The first question is : What muscle ?
Why do science relate to us ?
Don &apos;t just say that you study bone tissue , but you look at bone tissue , it &apos;s like the same ones that make our bones because we need to know about the gastric bone and the treatment .
When you describe science , be careful when you use the term .
<unk> means that we understand your ideas .
It may say , &quot; <unk> and <unk> &quot; but &quot; But &quot; and &quot; <unk> and I. &quot;
I mean , I think the idea of ideas is not going to be low .
Instead , like Mr. <unk> said , it &apos;s as simple as the <unk> , but don &apos;t just be simpler .
So obviously you can talk about the scientific issues without <unk> the idea .
So in mind , for example , storytelling , it &apos;s the way to engage , that &apos;s how to take it and make us interested in what you say .
And when you present , don &apos;t use the line .
Have you ever wondered why we call them the &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
When about the arrow ? <unk> is a marker , killing it , and they will kill your lecture .
So one slide is not a little bit boring , but it &apos;s not too much that it &apos;s too much about the language of the brain , which makes us <unk> .
Instead , this slide of <unk> Brown actually understood more . It shows the special structure of the powerful bone that it actually inspire the original design of the Right <unk> <unk> .
And the trick here is to use the simple and easy audiences that can rely on if they &apos;re not shining , and then use images that are captured to help us understand more deeply than the ones that are expressed .
I think this is just a couple of secrets that we can open up that door and see the spirit of science and technology .
So I worked with my team who I worked with , and I knew <unk> <unk> all walks . So I wanted to summarize with a radical .
&quot; science &quot; unless &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; jargon &quot; and &quot; jargon &quot; and &quot; jargon &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; is worth sharing with the audience , and then with the word &quot; passion &quot; he &apos;s given his work , what he &apos;s doing , then he &apos;ll give the results to the extraordinary collaboration .
And so , by the way , scientists and engineers , when you interpret this , are all the prices , let &apos;s say eight <unk> with me .
Thank you .
Hi . I &apos;m Cameron Russell , and in the short time , I was a prototype .
In fact , in 10 years .
And I felt that there was a non uncomfortable pressure in the room right now because I shouldn &apos;t wear this burqa .
Fortunately , I had a different set of furniture .
So this is the first time someone has a <unk> on the TED stage so I think you &apos;re very lucky to see this .
If some women feel very frightened when I came out , you don &apos;t have to say me right now , but I &apos;ll go through Twitter .
I realized I was very lucky to change what you think about me in 10 seconds of thinking .
Not everybody has the opportunity to do this .
These high heels are not comfortable , I &apos;m not going to have them .
The worst part is that the one that &apos;s going to reach this long arm by the end of the house , because you &apos;re smiling , and so don &apos;t do anything when it &apos;s on my head .
Okay .
Why did I do that ?
It &apos;s a weird thing .
In fact , hopefully it doesn &apos;t come as if it was the same .
The vision is powerful , but it &apos;s also a fake .
I just changed what you think about me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had no brother in my life .
I felt very uncomfortable at that time , and I felt like I was a photographer , and I <unk> my back to my hair .
And of course , unless surgery , or <unk> , I have two days before I have two days before , there are very few things that we can do to change our appearance , and our appearance , even though it &apos;s fake and <unk> , it has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , to me , it &apos;s not very afraid to be very , very afraid about being honest .
And I stood on this stage because I &apos;m a model .
I stood on this stage because I &apos;m beautiful , white women , and in the phantom , we call it a sexy girl .
And I &apos;ll answer the questions that people are asking me , but with real honesty .
The first question is , how do I become the person ?
And I always say , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m discovered , but it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
I actually became a model because I won the lottery to send the lottery , and I was the legacy of the legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what the legacy of the legacy is .
In the past decade , we &apos;ve redefined not just health and young , and the lack of symmetry we &apos;re programmed about are biological , but also the height , the <unk> lines and the <unk> , and white .
This is the legacy that &apos;s built for me and that is legacy that I made money for it .
I know there are some of you who are skeptical of this , and maybe some dressed dressed like , &quot; Wait . Naomi Ban . Percy <unk> . Joan Bolin . &quot;
I want to praise your understanding of your model . It &apos;s phenomenal .
But unfortunately I had to tell you 2007 , a Ph.D. student in New York University statistic that shows all of these models on the floor , and in <unk> , the person was hired by 27 percent , which is not white .
The next question that everybody asked me was , &quot; Can you be a model when I grew up ? &quot;
And my first answer is , &quot; You don &apos;t know , you &apos;re not pro recruitment . &quot;
But the next answer I really want to tell you about is , &quot; Why ? &quot;
You know what ? You can become anyone .
You can become President of America , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a <unk> surgeon , a <unk> heart surgeon , which is great , isn &apos;t it , because you &apos;re going to be the first person to do it . &quot;
If , after a list of cool , they say , &quot; No , Cameron , you want to be a model of &quot; , &quot; then I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Your boss , I &apos;m going to go . &quot;
Because you don &apos;t have any power , you can be the president of <unk> magazine in the U.S. or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M <unk> , or Steven <unk> .
I said that you want to be a model when I grew up like I said I wanted to win the lottery when I grew up .
It &apos;s in my control , and it &apos;s great , but it &apos;s not a career .
I &apos;m going to show you for 10 years of experience that I &apos;ve collected when I &apos;m making a model , because it &apos;s not like a cardiac surgeon , so it &apos;s just a short time .
If we were to have a photographer here , it &apos;s like a beautiful interface , and when the customer is a beautiful , and when the customer says , &quot; Cameron , we want the picture that you &apos;re going to go , and this leg goes , and the last one , this hand hit , and this is what it takes to come back , and this is what it takes to be , and you &apos;re just going to go back , you just need to do that , and then you go back , and you go back , and you can get it back , and then you go back to your head , and you can
Like this .
I hope it &apos;s less <unk> than the picture .
I don &apos;t know what happened at that moment .
It &apos;s ironic when you finish out , you write <unk> and used to do some things , you can &apos;t say anything else , because if you want to be president of the United States , your <unk> is recording : &quot; 10 years old , &quot; people would look at you with a different eye .
The next question that people ask me , &quot; Are all the images that are wired right ? &quot;
That &apos;s true , almost all the images are edited , but it &apos;s just a small factor in what &apos;s going on .
This is one of the first photos I &apos;ve ever taken , which was the first time I took my laundry photo , and I didn &apos;t even have my songs .
I know that we &apos;re going into the personal narrative , but I was a little girl .
This is my appearance , and I took her next to her next few months .
This is me in the same day when I took this picture on the table .
My friend had gone with me .
This is me at a dinner dinner a few days before I photographed the <unk> for the French Nazis .
This is me with a soccer team in the magazine magazine .
And here I am .
I hope you see images not my image .
These are the images that are built , and it &apos;s built by a group of experts , hair makers , radiologists , photographers , and all their assistants , and they all make their money , and their production , and they create this . These are not me .
The next question I &apos;ve been asking you is , &quot; Do you get free ? &quot;
I have a lot of <unk> <unk> , which I never had , but the free things that I got was the same thing that I had out of real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t want to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and I was in the shop , and I forgot to follow money and they gave me a free <unk> .
As a teenager , I was sitting in a friend &apos;s car , and she was a very scary driver and she was <unk> the red , and we were arrested , and all I did was said , &quot; I &apos;m afraid of police cop , and we were able to go .
I get the free things that are made out of my appearance , not because I am who I am and who are willing to spend money for their appearance , not because they are .
I live in New York , and I was in the last year , and in 140 thousand teenagers who were arrested and were <unk> , there are 86 percent of the black and the Indian , mostly young teenagers .
In New York , there are only <unk> people , and the Indian <unk> , so for them , the question is not &quot; Am I arrested ? &quot;
I &apos;m going to be going to be arrested and when ? &quot;
When I was preparing to give this talk , I discovered that that was that 53 percent of the 13 year olds in America don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number went up to 78 percent when they were 17 .
The last question that people ask me was , &quot; How do you feel when you &apos;re a prototype ? &quot;
I think what they want to hear is &quot; If you &apos;re thinner , and your hair is more <unk> , you &apos;re going to be happy and happy . &quot;
And when we were in the curtain , we gave the modern answer .
&quot; It &apos;s amazing to travel , and work with creative people , inspiring and enthusiasm . &quot;
And these are the facts , but it &apos;s just half the way , because what we never say before , which I never said before , is , &quot; I &apos;m safe . &quot;
I was safe because I had to think about my image every day .
And you &apos;ll ever ask yourself , &quot; If your destiny is bigger and your hair is more <unk> , then I &apos;m going to be happier ? &quot;
You just meet a group of people , because they have the most legs , the most <unk> hair and the most beautiful , and they can be the most insecure women on the planet .
When I wrote this speech , I was very hard to find a really , really balanced balance , because I felt very uncomfortable to say , &quot; I have all these because I &apos;m blessed , &quot; and I felt really upset to follow the sentence , &quot; but it &apos;s always been so frustrating to follow the sentence , &quot; but it &apos;s always not going to make me happy .
But mainly it &apos;s hard to take a legacy of sexuality and the ethnic problem while I &apos;m one of the biggest benefits .
But I &apos;m happy and I &apos;m happy to have this , I think , that it &apos;s luck I &apos;ve come before 10 , 20 or 30 years pass and I &apos;ve been working with companies in my career , because I could not be able to tell stories how I have the first work , or maybe I would not be talking about how I have a lot of money , whether it &apos;s right now .
If there &apos;s something that happens in this conversation , I hope it &apos;s all we feel comfortable when we admit the power of the image in perception of success and our failure .
Thank you .
There are many ways that people around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t touch each other , so there &apos;s a lot of wisdom that &apos;s never known , whether we share public spaces .
So a few years ago , I &apos;m trying to share more ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like paper paper , paper and excitement .
And these projects come from questions I asked , like , my neighbor had to pay how much money they have for their apartments ?
How do we put borrowing and borrow more things without typing the houses of the bad time ?
How do we share more than our memories of abandoned buildings , and we have to understand better about our landscape ?
And how do we share more of our hopes for the money stores of the money , like that , our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I &apos;m in New Orleans .
My soul always was <unk> by the oak trees , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> and the hundreds of years of <unk> , and I believe in the city that always makes music .
I feel like every time someone <unk> , New Orleans has a contest .
Cities have some of the most beautiful architectural structures in the world , but it also has a huge number of <unk> in the United States .
I live near this house , and I think how I can do it more beautiful for my neighborhood , and I also think about something that could change my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost a very good person .
Her name is Joan , and she was a mother for me , and her death was unexpected and unexpected .
And I thought about a lot of dying , and this makes me feel so intense for my time , and I gave clarity to what was meaningful to my life now .
But I struggled to keep the angle of this angle in my daily life .
I feel like it was easy to capture the day day , and forget what really meant to you .
So with the help of old and new friends , I took one of the buildings &apos;s buildings into a giant and a different piece of it with a <unk> in the drum , and it said , &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; so anyone who would go through you can pick up a piece of pollen , reflected their lives , and share their personal aspiration in public space .
I don &apos;t know what to expect from this trial , but the next day , the wall was completely covered , and it continued to grow .
And I want to share some of the things about people who write on that wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to try to steal . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I wanted to get myself on the edge of the International Day line . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to sing for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to grow a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live outside . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be held her again . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be somebody &apos;s ass . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be absolutely myself . &quot;
So this space is abandoned this space becoming a space of creation , and the hope and the dreams of everyone that make me laugh , and the tears of the people are laughing for me to come up with their hard time .
It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not only alone .
It &apos;s about understanding us in the new ways and <unk> .
It &apos;s about creating space for the reflection and testing , and remember what really matters with us when we grow up and change .
I did this project last year , and I started getting hundreds of letters from the people who wanted to make a wall in their community , so the community community centers and I do a tool , and now the walls that were being done in the world , including <unk> , South Africa , the <unk> , the Norwegian Brothers and many more .
Together , we &apos;ve shown our public spaces , how powerful we are if we were given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with another one .
The two key things we have is time and relationships with others .
In the age of increasing our distribution , this is more important than ever to find the way to maintain and remember that life is short and soft .
What death is is something we don &apos;t have been encouraged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve been realizing that preparing death is one of the most powerful things you can do .
Think about death as well as you know .
Our spaces are shared to be better than reflected back to what happens to us as individuals and as communities , and with more ways to share hope , fear and stories , people around us not only can we help us do better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Well , I do the math math and this is a different problem for anyone who makes math math , which is us like managing managers .
Nobody knows what we did .
So today I &apos;m going to try to explain to you what I do .
Well , jumping is one of the activities that people do .
We love the master Ballet dancer about three and stumbled up your legs , and we would see that there &apos;s this next one .
<unk> three <unk> requires a special and high tech level and a good level of magnitude that &apos;s relevant to this behavior .
Sadly , mental disorders like Parkinson &apos;s disease can destroy this particular possibility , which is what &apos;s going on for me my friend <unk> <unk> , who once once has a ballet ballet artist .
Over the past few years , there was tremendous progress in the treatment .
But <unk> million people worldwide have a disease , and they have to live in debilitating , <unk> , non lethal , non invasive and symptoms with this disease . What we need is tools for target goals to detect diseases before too late .
We need to measure the progress of a objective in our own way , and ultimately , the only way we know when we actually have a treatment , is that when we have a precise approach to answer .
But it &apos;s been very frustrating to treat Parkinson &apos;s and other traumatic disorders , and they don &apos;t have any physiological evidence , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best one we have is this neurologic test .
You need to get to the hospital to do it . It &apos;s very expensive , it &apos;s really a test that &apos;s outside clinical trials , it &apos;s never been done .
But if the patient can do this in the house ?
That would be a really free journey to the clinic , and if the patient can also make the same test , then what ?
It &apos;s not going to cost the gold hour of the staff .
It &apos;s about $ 300 , and it &apos;s about doing this test in the neuroscience Council .
So what I want to suggest for you is a traditional way of communicating that , so that you can get this , at least in some way , we are masters like Hardy <unk> .
Here we have a video of the sound that is vibrating .
This is healthy for us to be living and someone is saying , and we can see ourselves as <unk> , because we have to incorporate all of the facts when we created the sound , and we all have the genes to be able to charge that . So , for example , we have to do that .
It &apos;s like three suits that need to be safe .
I mean , it took a long idea to think about how long a kid would say .
From the sound , we can actually track the censorship position when we vibrate , when the <unk> are affected by Parkinson &apos;s , the acoustic organs are so well .
So in the bottom graph , you can see an example of the abnormal vibration .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see the <unk> , the frailty and the <unk> .
The speech becomes more frustrating and more wind after a time , and that &apos;s one of the symptoms of it .
These sound effects can actually be really hard to detect , in some cases , but with any digital <unk> , and using speech analysis , they &apos;re effectively going to be able to figure out where to be the right place in the system , which is very innovative , so we can quantify what people are saying in the system that &apos;s constantly <unk> and disease just using speech signals .
So how do we do this kind of thing that &apos;s going on with the speech , and what &apos;s the point of the clinical trial ?
Now neuroscience is not conquering . They &apos;re using infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design a whole new hospital system to go to this test .
And it &apos;s all about right . But one thing , experiment on the voice is not specialized .
That means it can be done .
Fast rate , only about 30 seconds in the maximum .
<unk> costs , and we all know what happens .
When something gets super low , it &apos;s going to be popular .
So here are some great targets that I think we can do now .
We can reduce the problem that we need for the patient .
It doesn &apos;t have to go to the clinic to check the magic .
We can do this as a high frequency of the high data data that gets targeted .
We can do a lot of mass use with low cost costs to perform clinical trials , the census on the population is the ability to address this first time .
We have the opportunity to start looking for the initial biological footprints of the prior before it &apos;s too late .
So to do the first steps to this , we &apos;re making the <unk> <unk> program .
With <unk> and <unk> , we aim to record the voice with a number of very large quantities globally to gather data and start processing four goals .
We have local residents that can access three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone who &apos;s healthy or getting Parkinson &apos;s disease can call up to cheap , and leave the audio , a few times , and I &apos;m really happy that we &apos;ve achieved six percent of the goals of the target for eight hours .
Thank you .
Tom <unk> : So Max , by taking all of the samples of the 10,000 people , you can tell who &apos;s healthy and who doesn &apos;t ?
What are you going to do from these samples ?
Max <unk> : Yeah . Well . So what happens is , when you call you a <unk> you have to have a patient or a <unk> .
You see , some people might not do that . Maybe they didn &apos;t call it .
But we &apos;re going to take a huge amount of data collecting data from all different cases , and the results have different circumstances that are important because we looked at the elements of the pollinators , and we looked for real real signs of the disease .
So now , what is the right point of 86 percent ?
More than that .
In fact , my students <unk> , I have to praise him , because he did some amazing work , he proved that this could actually be done in the mobile phone , that allowed this project to be done , and the accuracy is achieving 99 percent .
Nine nine . Yeah , a <unk> .
So , that means that people would probably probably be able to translate people from their mobile phones and do this test test , and people who have Parkinson &apos;s disease might call their voice , and then the doctor can test their own progress , and then the physician can test their own progress , seeing their health condition as they got sick .
Exactly .
Thank you very much . <unk> Max was born .
Thank you very much , Tom .
I live in the South .
This is the South Pole : <unk> , fast food , <unk> .
So the city planners together and they settled the Chinese name to bring it another thing . So they changed the south <unk> of <unk> , as if it &apos;s going to solve the <unk> of the <unk> in the city .
This is the Los Angeles .
<unk> , junk food , <unk> .
Like <unk> million other Americans , I lived in a desert desert desert where the Los Angeles Hall , the home of the <unk> bag , the dining table , and then went off .
What &apos;s interesting is that fast food food is killing more people than they have accidents and they run .
In the South Los Angeles , people are dying of preventable diseases .
For example , obesity in my area is five times higher than Beverly Hills , for example , that gap about 16 kilometers away .
I got bored when I had to witness this .
And I wondered , how do you feel when there &apos;s no food in the food , when you get out of your door , you have to see the bad effects that the food system does for where you live ?
I saw the wheelchair bought like the old car .
I see blood centers growing up like Starbucks .
And I realized that it had to end .
I realized that the main problem is the solution .
The food is the problem and food is also the solution .
And I felt tired of driving a 45 minute drive to buy a single apple that doesn &apos;t matter unless it was .
What I did was planted a food forest in front of my house .
It &apos;s on a field where we call a walk .
It &apos;s a little bit bigger than a <unk> , a <unk> .
The problem is , that land belongs to the city .
But you have to hold it .
So I thought , &quot; Great . I can do what I want , because that &apos;s my responsibility and I have to keep it . &quot;
And this is how I keep that land .
I was with my team , and the L.A. tiles , we started gathering and started planting food : fruit food , you know , both of these fruits .
We &apos;re a group of sharing to be a <unk> , a lot of different lives of people from different lives , from every city in the city , and they &apos;re completely committed , and everything we do was free .
And the garden , it &apos;s beautiful .
Then there was a <unk> .
Cities came to me , and the title is to give me a powerful office , asking me to break the garden . That &apos;s the office later to be a friend of court .
And I like , &quot; Well , are it really ? &quot;
A <unk> of building trees in the land where people don &apos;t care about ?
And I said , &quot; Okay . Let &apos;s bring it here . &quot;
Because this is not going to go anywhere .
Then the Los York Times receives news , Steve Lopez wrote a paper about it , and then with the commissioner commissioner , one of the green pieces of the lawn pieces sent a single petition on <unk> and with 900 letters , we succeeded .
We had a victory in the hands .
The council commissioner even calls and said they were <unk> and interested in what we &apos;re doing .
I mean , what is it that , why not ?
Lower America &apos;s head of the wilderness of the wilderness is its own city .
They own 42 square soil .
That &apos;s the equivalent of 20 times the centers .
It &apos;s enough to grow <unk> million tomato trees .
How do they not agree ?
Plant a tree will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
When the green amount of green costs you per dollar , it gives you a $ 75 product .
It &apos;s my faith , and I told people , let me build your food .
<unk> for themselves are just like printing money .
I have a legacy in the South .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refused to do something that was done in the real part of the day , which was created for me by some other people , and I was making my own .
I &apos;m an artist .
Do gardening , I &apos;m mine . I grew my work .
It &apos;s like a painter , a <unk> for walls , I , I &apos;m flying for the lawn wells , the commute .
I use a garden , and I used a canvas , and the trees and the trees are what I have for the fabric of the canvas .
You &apos;re going to be surprised with what the soil can do if you turn them into canvas .
You can &apos;t imagine how the sunflower is so cool and how they affect people .
So what happened ?
I witnessed my garden as a shared , a tool for transition of the landscape of mine .
To change the community , you have to change the part of the land .
We are the land .
You &apos;re going to be surprised to see how kids are affected .
Working is the most effective job and the most challenging work you can do , especially in inner .
And then you get the strawberries .
I remember one time , and a mother came up and had a daughter , and it was about 10 : 30 p.m. and they stayed in my <unk> and I was out and they were very ashamed .
I thought , I feel so bad because they were there and I told them , two people know , there &apos;s no way to do that .
This piece is on the road . It &apos;s the reason it &apos;s there .
I feel ashamed of seeing someone in the nearby I get to be hungry . And that &apos;s how much it tries to add for me to do this . People ask me , &quot; Yeah , you &apos;re not afraid of being your people stealing your food ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , of course , I don &apos;t fear them , I &apos;m not going to steal .
So they &apos;re just on the way .
The whole idea is that .
I want them to take them , but at the same time , I want them to have their health . &quot;
And there was another time when I was working in a homeless mall in the Los Angeles .
There are some men , they helped me throw me out of the truck .
So , the air is happy , and they share stories of the garden that have affected them and they used to grow their mother , with her before and in front of them , and it was really amazing to see that this idea has changed them , even though it was just a second .
So the green soil has continued to grow about 20 yards of garden .
We had about 50 people to participate in <unk> , and all of the pride .
If they grow <unk> , they will <unk> <unk> .
If they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
But if no one &apos;s showing them that , if they don &apos;t see the effects of food to the brain and the body , they would be blindly <unk> whatever they are in front of them .
I see the young people who wanted to work , but they were busy , and I found these colorful kids and they just follow the road , and they were not going to lead to it .
With gardening , I see a chance that we can guide the kids to feed their communities , and there &apos;s a sustainable life .
And when we do that , who knows ?
Maybe we &apos;ll produce George Washington to move in .
But if we don &apos;t change the part of the land , we will never do it .
This is one of my plans . This is what I wanted to do .
I wanted to grow a whole piece of garden where people can share food .
I want to take the <unk> of traffic jams and make them happy into a coffee cafe .
Don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about free things , because free is not sustainable .
What &apos;s interesting about sustainability , that &apos;s you have to maintain it .
I &apos;m talking about the work of work for people , and we &apos;re going to take them out of the street , and give them a sense of joy and joy and joy when food comes to self grow , to open farmers .
What I want to do here , we &apos;ll make it sexy .
I want all of us to become the green rebels , the <unk> makers .
We &apos;ll change the concept of <unk> .
If you &apos;re not a garden , you don &apos;t have to be <unk> .
<unk> with your <unk> , okay ?
And let &apos;s make it happen to you .
Basically , if you want to meet me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and join meetings where you talk about doing this , where you &apos;re talking about doing this , and you &apos;re <unk> .
If you want to meet me , go to your garden with your <unk> and you &apos;ll grow a few things .
Hi . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya with the National National Park .
And behind me , I was my father &apos;s cow , and on the back of the cow , the National Park .
The National Park are not constrained in the area of the south area , which means that wildlife like horses escape the park in a liberal way .
And so the animals eat like lions followed them , and this is what lions do .
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the guys that was killed in the evening , and when the wake up in the morning I found it dead , and I felt very sad , because that was the only cow that we had .
My community , the <unk> , believed that we went from heaven with all of our animal and all the land to keep them , which is why we &apos;re very generous to them .
So I grew up with the <unk> of lions .
The fighters protect us and the cattle , and it was very concerned about this .
So they kill the lion .
This is one of the six lions who was killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why the lion in the National Park is very little .
Every son from six to nine year olds , in my community , suffered to milk the cows of his father , and I also had to do the same thing .
So I had to figure out how to fix this problem .
The first idea I had was using fire , because I think lions are <unk> .
But then I realized that the fire wasn &apos;t really working , because it even helps lions see the cows .
But I didn &apos;t give up . I kept thinking .
And my second idea is to use the <unk> .
I tried to deceive those lions &#91; to the Think of thinking &#93; that I was standing near the near <unk> .
But lions are very smart .
They went day and saw the dragon , and they come back , and then they came back , but the second day , they came and they said this wasn &apos;t moving , it always was there .
And then lions jump in and kill animals .
So at night , I took a <unk> tree around the barn , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t go .
I discovered that lions fear their motion .
So I had a clue .
Since a kid , I used to work in my room all day day , and I even opened my new radio to buy my mother , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electricity .
So I took a piece of a car tank , a joint box , and it &apos;s a little device that was found in the car and it helped the driver go out when they want to turn the fruit or turn it right . It &apos;s rolling .
And I get a switch to maybe turn off and open light .
And that &apos;s a little lamp from a <unk> lamp .
And I installed everything .
As you can see , the solar panel takes the battery , and the battery provides the energy to the clock , and I call it the <unk> .
And the box box is a meter bulb that makes light light .
As you can see , the lights are out outside , because that &apos;s the lion &apos;s eye .
And that &apos;s how light shows the lion when they arrived at night .
The flash lights turned off and <unk> lions made them think that I was walking around the barn , but actually I was sleeping on my bunk beds .
Thank you .
I installed it in my home two years ago , since then , we didn &apos;t have to have any problems with lions .
The neighbors hear about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of cattle killed , and she asked me if I could help her build the electric shadows .
I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I installed the lightbulbs . You can see it behind , they &apos;re the spores .
So far , I &apos;ve been building for seven families in my community , and they &apos;re working .
Now my idea was used all over Kenya to get rid of other predators like hyena , leopards , and it also used to be used to threaten the farmers from the farmers &apos;s farm .
By the way , I was fortunate enough to learn a fellowship in one of the best schools in Kenya , in the <unk> economy , and I was really excited about this .
My new school is starting to help and raise awareness .
I even led my friends to my community , and we installed the lights for the families who hadn &apos;t worked on it and I teach them how to put them .
A year ago , I was just a young kid in the Caribbean of a <unk> , and I was looking at the planes , and I told myself that one day , I would be sitting in the inside .
And I &apos;m here today .
I had the opportunity to come here with the first airplane to get TEDsters .
My greatest dream is to become a plane engineer and a pilot growing up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention was saving the banjo of father and lions , we could live with lions without any conflict .
<unk> <unk> . According to my language , it means thank you very much .
I don &apos;t know if I hear my story .
So you &apos;ve got a scholarship . Yes .
I &apos;m making some of the invention of the other electricity .
What &apos;s next ?
My will , you want to do a piece of wire , and what drives ?
I know that the fences were invented , but I wanted to do my own .
I tried , right , and I did it before , but she stopped for a shock .
Richard <unk> , I was very different .
We &apos;re going to be a little lonely in the road , and you &apos;re going to go .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
What I did , and what I did about my life was I was assigned for seven years of work in Africa as young .
Since 1977 came to 1977 , I was young , not that I worked in Zambia , Kenya , the Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in these projects of work with African nations .
I worked for the NGO &apos; chief of the art and each project that we &apos;ve created in Africa .
I was very <unk> brain brain .
At 21 years old , I thought , Italian people , and we &apos;re doing good work in Africa .
But instead of course , we killed everything we touch .
The first project , which inspired my first book , &quot; <unk> waves from <unk> , &quot; is a project in which Italian people decide to teach the real food .
So we were in <unk> with seeds from the country in a beautiful valley that went down to the <unk> River , and we teach people to grow their tomato bags and their <unk> and ...
Of course the locals are not interested in doing this , so we paid them , and sometimes they &apos;re going to work .
We were really surprised about the locals , in the <unk> Valley like this , and there &apos;s no farming .
But instead of asking why they &apos;re not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God , we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; Just keep saving people from hungry hunger . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa is good .
We have great tomatoes . At Italy , a single tomato , big tomato , it &apos;s about this size .
It &apos;s hard to believe , and we said to people who are <unk> , &quot; You see the farming . &quot;
When the tomato sauce starts to get started , nine , and there &apos;s red , just overnight , about 200 of the galaxies from the river up to the river and drinking all .
We said to people who are nerds , &quot; My god , the <unk> ! &quot;
And people said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s why we don &apos;t have any stuff here . &quot;
&quot; So why don &apos;t you tell us before ? &quot; &quot; You Have ever asked . &quot;
I thought only every single person is naive in Africa , but then when I look at what Americans are doing , the British are doing , the French are doing , and after seeing what they do , I feel that there was something proud of my project at Zambia .
Because , you see , there are few , we also feed the code .
You should look at the crap you should look at the crap that we &apos;ve given Africans without <unk> .
You want to read something , read the dead <unk> , &quot; <unk> by Astor Salim , an <unk> woman .
The book was released in 2009 .
We , Western aid nations , brought Africa two billion U.S. sections in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that the money has been .
Go find her book .
Reading it from a African woman , the damage that we &apos;ve been making .
The West are the ones that are the dominant <unk> , the <unk> , and we have only two ways to treat others : or for aid , or save .
Two words from the Latin word of <unk> , which means &quot; parenting . &quot;
They &apos;re two different meanings .
I was in my office , and I treat anyone from the other culture as if they were my child . &quot; I love them too . &quot;
I treat all of you from the other culture as I am .
That &apos;s why white people in Africa are called &quot; <unk> , &quot; his boss .
I was being scooped on the face of reading books , &quot; <unk> , &quot; but I wrote by <unk> , said , on <unk> , on the economic development , if others don &apos;t need help , let alone them .
So this should be the first commandment for aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the organizers of this meeting , put a stick in the floor , and said , &quot; Can we picture a city without new democratic means ? &quot;
When 27 years old , I decided to just touch people and I created a system called <unk> <unk> , where you wouldn &apos;t begin to take anything you never nudge who you &apos;re going to ever nudge , but being a fully educated person who has dreams who dream to be better .
So what you do is you &apos;re going to stop your mouth .
Never bring a community to the ideas , you &apos;re sitting with the locals .
We didn &apos;t work from offices .
We met in the cafe . The <unk> .
We don &apos;t have any infrastructure .
And what we did is we become each other , and we found what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is to hope .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , then you have to do it ?
The aspiration of the woman has a new rise to the development of the story as the most important .
The <unk> of men has a personal advance for the importance of the most important .
And we helped them go to search for the understanding , because nobody else in the world could succeed alone .
The idea has not been the idea of knowing , but the understanding is always visible .
So many years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , just one , instead of , instead of , to a community , and say to people where they should do , we don &apos;t , we listen to them for one time ? But not in public meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There &apos;s a problem in public meetings .
The entrepreneurs never come to the project , and they didn &apos;t have to tell you , in the community meetings , what they wanted to do with their money , the opportunity they &apos;ve found .
So there &apos;s a point of blindness .
The smartest people in the community you never know about because they &apos;re not going to go to the public meetings .
What we did is we work one thing to do and to do that , you have to create a social structure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new professional .
A new professional like a family doctor offers business , family doctor who works with you in your house , at the table in the kitchen , at the cafe , and helps you find resources to make your desire to make your desire a living .
I started as a <unk> experiment in <unk> , K Australia .
I was in philosophy at the time , trying to avoid the luxury of the proper protection , and to tell you what to do .
So what I did in the first year in <unk> was just the only thing on the road , and in the three days I had my first clients who had a ham <unk> in the car , called <unk> , and I helped him sell fish fish for a restaurant in <unk> , and the organization is going to work , and then somebody who gets me to me and said he was helping me TED ? Can you help me ?
And I helped these fish know how to work together and sell this crazy tuna not for the box factory at <unk> with 60 cents a sign , but we looked to sell them to Japan to do eBay with 15 dollars a sign , and then the farmers went to the place , saying , &quot; Hey , he helped the people to help us help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 consecutive projects and the government of government to ask me , &quot; How did you do that ?
How did he do it ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I did a very , very hard job .
I was blind , and I listen to them . &quot;
So the government says to me , &quot; Let &apos;s do it . &quot;
We did that at 300 communities around the world .
We helped the 40,000 jobs of the forage .
There &apos;s a new generation of entrepreneurs who are busy because of isolation .
Peter <unk> , one of the great management problems in history , through the age of 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Sarnoff is a philosophy before working in business , and this is what Peter <unk> says : &quot; <unk> is really not compatible with a society and an economic economy . &quot;
Planning is a death kiss for the entrepreneurs .
So now you &apos;re reusing again that you &apos;re doing the most well not knowing what the smartest people at UCL want to do with the money of the speech .
You have to learn how to make these people go to you .
You have to give them a security , private , you have to really start to get them , and they will come , in the crowd that pulls it .
With a 10,000 human community , we can have about 200 clients .
<unk> can imagine a colleague of 53 people , and <unk> intelligence and aspiration ?
What &apos;s the lecture that you clap in the morning ?
<unk> , people who aspire . These are friends who are clapping .
So what I &apos;m talking about is the business of business is where it is present .
We are at the last stage of the early Industrial Revolution with the fuel , renewable source of fuel , and the <unk> , we have these unsustainable systems .
<unk> in unsustainable air .
The <unk> Street line to store things is unsustainable .
What we have to look at is how we can nurture , treat , education , move and communicate for seven billion sustainable people .
There &apos;s no technology done .
What &apos;s <unk> going to invent the technology of the green revolution ? How do we get away !
What government ? Forget !
That would be the list , and they &apos;re doing it right now .
There &apos;s a very happy story that I read on a very , very senior , five year old New York .
There &apos;s a group of experts invited to discuss the future of New York City in <unk> .
And in <unk> , the people who gathered together , and they rescued what happened to New York City in 100 years , and the most expected of the New York was : New York City will no longer exist for 100 years .
Why ? Because they look at the curve on the graph and said , if the population continues to grow in this scale , to move a population of the city of New York City , they would have to go six million horses , and the waste of six million horses are not going to have any way to deal with .
They &apos;d be overwhelmed in the horse .
So in <unk> , they saw this <unk> <unk> technology that makes life in the City of New York City .
So what happened ? In the last 40 years , to the point of 1900 , in the United States , there were <unk> company that were <unk> .
The idea of finding a different technology has completely overcome all over them and there are very small factories in the <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> . Henry Ford .
However , there &apos;s a secret to entrepreneurs .
First of all , you have to give them a secure charge .
No , they &apos;re not going to go to you .
Then you have to give them a great service , and you have to be very drunk .
And then you have to tell them the facts .
The smallest company , the largest company , has to have three great jobs three great things : the production that you want to sell , you have to have a perfect strategy , and you have to have a prime financial governance .
Think about it ?
We &apos;ve never met a single person in the world who has just been able to sell it , sell it and run money at the same time .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This character has never been born .
We did a study , and we looked at 100 typical companies in the Carnegie Mellon world , <unk> , from Mozambique , Ford , Ford , all new brand companies Google .
There &apos;s only one thing that all companies succeed in the world have , one that &apos;s one that &apos;s : no one started to start with one person .
We &apos;re now teaching business businesses at the age of 16 at <unk> , and we started the classroom by bringing them two first squares of the <unk> by Richard <unk> , and the work for these 16 year olds is the tiles , in two pages of the <unk> of Richard <unk> , how many times Richard <unk> used from &quot; I &quot; and how many times he used &quot; We . &quot;
Never word &quot; I , &quot; and &quot; we &quot; have 32 times .
He didn &apos;t start alone .
<unk> started a company . No one .
So we can create a community where there are people who have dedicated the background of the micro scale of micro scale , in the cafe , in the cafe , and your friends who are dedicated to your friends who are going to make them talk about their identity , someone who &apos;s going to ask you , &quot; What do you need ? &quot;
What can you do ? Can you do it ?
Okay , you can sell it ? Can you manage money ?
&quot; Oh , no , I can &apos;t do this . &quot; You want me to find somebody else else ? &quot;
We activate the communities .
We have volunteers that help the <unk> <unk> to find the <unk> and the human resources and we discovered that the miracle of the locals is in the same way that something like you can challenge culture and the economics of this community is just by receiving the sense of the culture , the energy and the imagination of your own as your own .
Thank you .
So to March , 2011 , I did a custom maker in New York City .
We &apos;re a little blue creature .
It &apos;s hidden in the dark room , and it &apos;s generally avoiding the sun .
We <unk> the Tahltan people , more beautiful , more beautiful , turning things impossible , and always getting the instructions on the press , but in us also have talented artists with many years of experience and understanding what &apos;s on pictures and pictures .
In November 2011 , following the world in the house , I saw dramatic events happening in Japan .
Then , I joined <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I went to a few days to the help of the attempt to tackle .
I , along with hundreds of volunteers , believe that not only was sitting home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May 13 , I went to the <unk> <unk> town .
It &apos;s a small <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , about 50,000 people , one of the first places that affected the tsunami .
The water is being recorded over 24 meters , and it &apos;s going to be more than three miles deep in the land .
Maybe the town was devastated .
We pulled down the fragments from the channel , the chest .
<unk> school , sanitation , they &apos;re ready for innovation and rehabilitation .
We clean tons of rotting <unk> and depression from the local shark processing plant .
We <unk> <unk> , but everybody was happy .
In many weeks , volunteers and local people were looking for something .
They looked for images and photos and <unk> and <unk> .
It &apos;s all done .
They collected and they talk to them to protect them in places around the world .
It &apos;s not that I &apos;ve been able to see these pictures that are actually a very large part of the personal loss of these people .
When I run the wave , to keep the net , they left all the things , everything was left behind .
At the end of the week there , I went to help a family clinic in the town .
I helped clean water waters , the huge water bath .
This is also where the brain has collected the photo .
This is where the people are talking to them , and then I took a great pleasure , because they trust me to allow me to wipe them clean .
It was very moved and excited . Before that , I heard that I had to think clear to the framework , but only when I really experienced that , the new myth happened .
When I look through images , there were some more photos of the year , some of the people in the back of the <unk> room . I thought , a <unk> person I could repair and that <unk> , and I know , hundreds of other people can do that .
So , I went to Facebook and I asked a few people , and I went to the morning , and I got a lot of positive feedback , I knew that I got to go .
We started to edit these pictures .
This is the first one .
No damage , but it was <unk> water that makes her face face , had to be treated with exactly the same and exquisite .
If you don &apos;t , girls in the shape would not look like you , and certainly that &apos;s the same as the picture of the damage .
Over time , very lucky , many of the <unk> are coming back , and needs more people to edit , so again , I went Facebook and <unk> , in five days , I found 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people who wanted to participate .
In Japan , in July , we expanded the <unk> of <unk> , far beyond the north to <unk> <unk> .
Every week , we installed our scanned in the makeshift library , and we used to have used them before , so that people come back to their photos .
The older women who have never seen the scanner , but after 10 minutes , searching their photos , give us to scan , upload a cloud of cloud , to download it by a <unk> , a stranger , somewhere in the world , somewhere in the world , and start to be edited .
Time spent to restore the cause of a completely different narrative , and obviously depends on the lack of the <unk> .
It can take one hour . It can take a week .
It &apos;s probably going to take months .
The <unk> <unk> in this picture almost has to be painted by hand , or decay , from the color and details of the other , not damaged .
It takes time .
Now , all these images have been destroyed by water , <unk> in salt water , covered by bacteria , in the water , sometimes in oil , during a time so they should continue more of the damage . So clean them is a very big part of the project .
We can &apos;t fix it if we didn &apos;t clean it , dry and recyclable .
We &apos;ve been lucky with the <unk> of hand .
There was a great woman who has led us to .
It &apos;s very easy to harm these images that have damage .
My <unk> team once said , it &apos;s like tattoos .
You don &apos;t have a mistake .
The woman gives us these pictures , and they were able to get restored .
She cleaned up cleaning them and stopped as she realized she was doing more damage .
She had a picture of the picture .
If not , places like husband and face , you never get to be restored , only if you can put them closer together in a different image , and you can do it all the same .
When we get the pictures from us , she shared a little bit of his story .
These pictures are co met by her husband &apos;s own <unk> , and the bits of cracks were long told from the long distance where there was a broken home , and they noticed him .
The tsunami , he was responsible for the tsunami , the tsunami .
He had to go back to the line where the <unk> would hit .
Two little boys , no longer smaller , two boys of her son are in school , two different schools .
One was stuck in the water .
A week , she found them and knew that all of them were alive .
I returned to her also the day of her son &apos;s son , 14 year old son .
For her , after all , these pictures are the perfect gift for his boy , something that could look back , to remember the past before the <unk> of the day , when the entire life was finally turned down or destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1,300 volunteers have joined <unk> <unk> , which , in which hundreds of billions of people have 100 billion clean miles clean than than than than than <unk> , most of the majority of the images have been coming back to their owner , this is what matters .
Over the year hundred of the global volunteers helped pay for more than 90 families , hundreds of photos were completely restored and fixed .
In this time , we didn &apos;t spend a thousand dollars for the equipment and materials , most of which cost for the printer .
We take a picture of it .
Each picture is about somebody or something , a place , a different relationship .
They are records of memories and our story , which is the last one we have to be <unk> and also the first thing we &apos;ve come to find .
It &apos;s the meaning of the entire project , restoring the smaller pieces of humanity , bringing the connections to someone .
When a photograph is brought back , it will create a huge transformation in the lives of the recipient .
The project also creates a huge difference in the lives of the people who are going to cooperate .
For some people , they &apos;ve been connected to something that &apos;s tremendous , giving something , using their own talents something more than a simple model and a mouse <unk> .
I wanted to read a letter to end this talk . This email from <unk> , a man who helped me , sent me back from Japan after six months .
&quot; When I work , I couldn &apos;t think of each individual and the stories that contain it in the photographs .
There &apos;s a picture , and there &apos;s a lot of women in the house , and from young to young , from children , together , around a baby , who beat me for my home , and the same thing , my mom , my mom , me , and my daughter , and my daughter , and my daughter , and my picture was hanging on on the wall .
The other way around the globe , no matter what , our basic need are , are we ? &quot;
Thank you .
I was at the deep depths of <unk> under a illegally illegal mine in Ghana .
The <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> , and it &apos;s difficult to breathe .
I can feel the collision from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> through the dark , but it can &apos;t be seen .
I heard the words , but almost the whole block is a blend of laughter and rock that fell with raw tools .
As people , I put a cheap , cheap , cheap fast battery on the top , which is in the old rubber ring , I almost couldn &apos;t see the <unk> <unk> of the massive square foot of the massive square foot hole that came down to the ground .
When I was working , I remember the new <unk> who had a few days before that was blown down the lawn .
When I talk to you today , these people are still in the hole , and they &apos;re living in that hole without having a good or a <unk> , and often die .
I was out of that hole , and I was home , but they might never be home , because they were in the slavery .
In the last 28 years , I &apos;ve collected local literature over 70 countries on six continents , and 2009 I had the privilege to become the only exhibit at the UN at the Smithsonian of Vancouver .
Of those amazing , astonishing talent I met there , I met a <unk> for the <unk> campaign , a member of the Nigerian government who ended up eating the modern slavery of modern slavery .
We started talking about slaves , and actually , I started to learn about slavery because I knew that it was on the world , but it wasn &apos;t that much .
After the talk , I was really terrible and really embarrassing for ignorance about this kind of devastation in my life , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many would you know ?
It starts to <unk> the care , so a few weeks later , I flew to Los Angeles to meet the <unk> <unk> , and asked them .
And then we began the journey of the modern world .
The strange thing I &apos;ve been to most of these places .
Some of my people are like my home .
But this time , I want to see the truth that &apos;s being uploaded .
A <unk> of <unk> gave us a more than 27 million people who are displaced in the world today .
It &apos;s double people who are taken out of Africa during the entire period of selling slavery across the Atlantic Ocean .
150 years ago , a cable that was twice three times more than the annual American .
That &apos;s for 50,000 U.S. dollars today .
But today , many generations of households are drawn through generations with $ 18 .
It &apos;s amazing how much slavery that we have , the slavery of the United States , a year of profits , a year of over 13 billion dollars a year worldwide .
Many people were deceived by the <unk> <unk> of good education , better work , just to see who I was being done under violent violence , and not stepping out .
This day that &apos;s serving commercial trade , which is the <unk> that the slaves created , but the creator of the person is actually as much as a waste of a waste .
The modern slavery is almost everywhere in the world , although it &apos;s illegal in any place .
In India and Nepal , I was given a pole .
This strange scene of view looks like it &apos;s going to the world in Egypt or by the <unk> of Jacob .
<unk> in the temperature of 54 degrees centigrade , men , women , children , all families , are locked in the <unk> bed , do the machine , blocks up to the top , to 18 bricks every time , and they take them from heavy piles to the truck truck in a hundred meters .
<unk> came by <unk> and exhausted , and they were silent , and they were going to follow over and over and over and over and over again 16 hours a day .
There &apos;s no food , it &apos;s going to take food , because it &apos;s going to take a drink , so it &apos;s going to be a lot of serious stuff .
Okay , so that bush and the bush spread everywhere that my camera was so hot that it couldn &apos;t touch the button .
For 20 minutes , I had to go back to the Caribbean of the war to wipe up the equipment and leave them under the heat of recovery , and when I sit there , I think , my camera is much better than the other .
So back to the kiln , I just want to cry , but the person who <unk> along the counter is going to take me and say , &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
He explained that it was very dangerous that emotion is very dangerous in this place , not to me , but with them .
I couldn &apos;t help them .
I didn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I &apos;m not a citizen .
I can put them into a much worse situation .
I have to rely on the <unk> <unk> to work in the system to release them , and I believe they can .
For me , to wait towards the home to really feel pain .
In the Himalayas , I saw children <unk> through several kilometers of mountain miles down to the road in the bottom of the road .
The big rocks are heavy than the kids who carried them , the kids lifted them up with their heads using their <unk> , their rope and their fabric .
<unk> are so heavy .
How can we create this kind of <unk> , but what &apos;s the impact ?
Some people don &apos;t even know if they were turned into slaves , and they worked with 16 hours a day , and they were a day of time , because they were just so short of their lives .
They don &apos;t have anything to do with it .
When this village is free , their <unk> <unk> .
These people have nothing , they die , they want to be their customers , but women in the middle of the middle of the town and they call people <unk> , and they <unk> the status of the scene at the school school , so they can take their contract together for their own quarries , so they do it , and they &apos;re paid , and they &apos;re being paid , and they do it in free .
We often think about sex trade when we hear from the &quot; slave , &quot; and this general awareness , I &apos;m going to be very <unk> to work safely in this particular industry .
In <unk> , I was escorted by women who were women who were sexual slaves .
They took me down to the stairs down into the dirty basement , in the hidden light .
This is not a reservation .
It &apos;s a restaurant more like a restaurant .
<unk> , like being known in the industry , are the locations of prostitution .
Every place there &apos;s a little room where the slaves , the <unk> , the young boys and the girls , the children , some seven , are challenged to be <unk> for customers , for example they buy more wine and food .
They &apos;re dirty and they &apos;re very dirty , and they &apos;re very soon realized by the number of paint on the wall by the <unk> and the curtain .
The person here is often not taking abuse of the <unk> of the thousands of <unk> .
I was sitting in the corner of the dark corner , and I remember feeling that the fear of the fear , and that moment , I just understood how hell I was in that hell .
There &apos;s only one way : the staircase that I went in .
There &apos;s no <unk> .
There &apos;s not enough big windows that go out .
These people have no escape , when we &apos;re talking about the hard topic , to remember that slavery , the slave of sex , the sex of sex , also happens where we live .
Thousands of people are arrested in agriculture , in the restaurant , full of conflict , and the long list .
Recently , New York Times reported that from 100,000 to 300,000 children , the United States is sold to sexual slavery every year .
It &apos;s around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
<unk> is often thought about the <unk> of the slave .
I went to a lot of villages in India , where many families were drawn in a <unk> .
This is a family portrait .
<unk> are the father , the <unk> , the blue , the red boys .
They mix in the big barrels of the big box , and they put them out of the liquid that would fill it into the <unk> , and they <unk> very toxic medications .
My <unk> storyteller .
They said , &quot; We don &apos;t have free freedom .
But still hope that someday can leave the house and go somewhere else where we were paid over the fabric . &quot;
It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are slave in <unk> , the largest artificial profile lake in the world .
So the first time I went , I went to a line .
I see the same thing as a family beating on the boat , two boys , little children , and they seem to be rational ?
Wrong . They were slaves .
Children are taken out of their families , sell them and lose , and being done on these boats , no matter what they don &apos;t know .
This child was eight years old .
And I shake up to my sailboat , and I was almost afraid of the boat to get over her tiny <unk> .
He was terrified of fear to get down to the water .
<unk> branches to <unk> <unk> , and the kids just <unk> their <unk> and were terrified of being pushed down to the water .
Many of them die .
What he missed , was that she was arrested in the lake .
It &apos;s too scary , you don &apos;t have to run away , and because of the bad damage of being bad from the small , you &apos;re going to do that down to smaller slaves that you manage .
I met these boys at 5 in the morning , when they were pulling the last grid , but they did work from an hour .
At night , the sun was <unk> .
It takes attention to the idea that these nets are heavy sometimes when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce Kofi to you .
Kofi was saved from a single village .
I met him in the rescue room that the <unk> <unk> restored against victims of slaves .
Here she &apos;s bathed in the Himalayas , and the big <unk> of water , and the great news is , when you and I sit in the talk today , Kofi was reunited with his family , and more or more , her family was released to live and keep the kids safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of the capability of the capability .
You become somebody who is going to stand up and change your life ?
<unk> on the road in Ghana , also the same colleagues in the <unk> <unk> , a friend who is in the safari <unk> of a car car that was suddenly increasing the speed of cars , and knocking into the window .
He told us that we went on the road of a kind of <unk> in the woods .
At the end of the road , he <unk> us to leave the car , and he would give the driver a ride .
And then just in this fuzzy footprint and said , &quot; This is the Road , this is the aisle . Go away . &quot;
So , we put the line off the line , and then about about one hour walk in the woods , the traces landed in the back of the back of the rains , so I had a shot of paper that was made on the water , and then we went down to the depths of the water .
After two hours of adventure , the traces around the <unk> , the <unk> of the drum , and before our eyes were a very <unk> , full of <unk> , full of <unk> .
Many women are pregnant in their backs while they &apos;re gold , and they &apos;re buried through the country alone .
It &apos;s been used in the process of extracted .
These miners are drawn to a <unk> in a different area of Ghana .
When you get out of the basement , people fell out of their <unk> because of their sweat .
I remember looking at the <unk> <unk> , and they were tired of many people who were under the ground to 72 hours .
The tunnels that come down to a hundred meters , they get <unk> up to <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get them to get to the other part , which is <unk> to get the gold .
Look , the arena <unk> the <unk> , but when you look closer , there are more poor luck than we do in extreme situations , and there are children .
They &apos;re victims of trauma , disease and violence .
In fact , many of the people who have finally been the same , the same , the <unk> , the <unk> , the infected of a few years .

They know their images , they &apos;re going to be seen by people out there , like you know .
I want them to know that we &apos;re going to do it for them , and we will do whatever we can to help them change .
I really believe , if we look at people like gay beings , it &apos;s very hard to drill the atrocities of the cybercriminals .
